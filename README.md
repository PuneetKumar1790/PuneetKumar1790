# Hi, I’m Puneet 👋  

🧠 Systems-oriented Developer | Security & Program Analysis Enthusiast  
🎓 Computer Science Undergrad — University of Delhi  

I enjoy working close to the **core of software systems** — debugging, refactoring, analyzing behavior, and making complex codebases safer and easier to reason about.  
Currently exploring **reverse engineering, low-level internals, and tooling for program analysis**, alongside selective backend and applied AI work.

## 🔹 Technical Focus

### Core Interests
- Program analysis & debugging  
- Reverse engineering fundamentals  
- Memory safety, refactoring & testability  
- Tooling, CI, and developer ergonomics  
- Security-aware systems design

**Also worked with:**  
Node.js, FFmpeg, Kafka, MongoDB, CI/CD, API security, JWT  

🔹 Currently focusing on:  
- Modern C++ practices (APIs, ownership, refactoring)  
- Understanding large C/C++ codebases  
- Debugging workflows & test-driven fixes

## 🔹 Selected Projects & Work

### ShieldStream  
🛡️ **Security-focused backend system (API-first)**  
- Designed token-based secure media delivery with **short-lived credentials**  
- Emphasis on **threat modeling**, misuse prevention, and access control  
- Focused on correctness, failure modes, and observability  

> Built to reason about how systems fail — not just how they work.

---

### YTGrabber  
🎥 CLI-style utility for controlled media extraction  
- Built using **yt-dlp + FFmpeg**
- Explored format parsing, stream handling, and error recovery  
- Local-first execution (Linux / Termux friendly)

---

### NutriLens  
AI-assisted analysis tool for ingredient interpretation  
- Emphasis on **input validation, prompt control, and deterministic scoring**
- Focused on making LLM output *inspectable and bounded*

---

### College Check-In System  
Backend system integrating **external signals (SMS ingestion)**  
- Designed ingestion → parsing → storage → analytics pipeline  
- Focused on **idempotency, validation, and secure API access**

---

## 🔹 Exploratory Work

- Studying reverse engineering workflows & tooling  
- Learning how large open-source C/C++ projects manage:
  - ownership
  - memory
  - refactors
  - long-term maintainability  

- Light exposure to robotics & simulation concepts (ROS ecosystem)  
  — mainly to understand how **complex systems expose state & behavior**
